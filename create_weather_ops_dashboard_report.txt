### Create Weather_ops Dashboard Report

#### Overview
The **Create Weather_ops Dashboard** stage in the Jenkins pipeline is responsible for setting up a custom Grafana dashboard to monitor the `Weather_ops` application. This dashboard provides visualizations and insights into key metrics such as HTTP request rates, response times, error rates, and model performance. It is a critical step for enabling real-time monitoring and proactive issue detection.

#### Key Actions in the Create Weather_ops Dashboard Stage

1. **Simulated Dashboard Creation**
   - If the `FORCE_K8S_DEPLOY` parameter is set to `false`, the pipeline simulates the creation of the Weather_ops dashboard by logging the steps that would be performed in a real deployment.
   - Simulated steps include:
     - Creating a preconfigured Weather_ops application dashboard.
     - Setting up monitoring for HTTP requests, latency, and error rates.
     - Adding visualizations for model predictions and training counts.
   - Commands executed:
     ```bash
     echo "Simulating dashboard creation..."
     echo "In a real environment, this would:"
     echo "- Create a preconfigured Weather_ops application dashboard"
     echo "- Set up monitoring for HTTP requests, latency, and error rates"
     echo "- Add visualizations for model predictions and training counts"
     echo "- Configure automatic dashboard refresh"
     ```

2. **Actual Dashboard Creation**
   - If the `FORCE_K8S_DEPLOY` parameter is set to `true`, the pipeline creates a custom Grafana dashboard for the Weather_ops application.
   - Commands executed:
     ```bash
     echo "Creating a Weather_ops dashboard in Grafana..."
     mkdir -p kubernetes/grafana/dashboards
     cat > kubernetes/grafana/dashboards/weather-ops-dashboard.json << 'EOF'
     { ...JSON content for the dashboard... }
     EOF

     # Create ConfigMap for dashboards
     kubectl create configmap grafana-dashboards-json -n weather-ops --from-file=weather-ops-dashboard.json=kubernetes/grafana/dashboards/weather-ops-dashboard.json --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

     # Apply the updated dashboard configurations
     kubectl apply -f kubernetes/grafana/grafana-dashboard-configmap.yaml
     kubectl apply -f kubernetes/grafana/grafana-dashboard-deployment.yaml

     # Restart Grafana to pick up the changes
     kubectl rollout restart deployment/grafana -n weather-ops

     echo "Weather_ops dashboards created successfully."
     echo "Access the dashboard at: http://localhost:3000/d/weather-ops/weather-ops-application-dashboard"
     echo "(after setting up port-forwarding)"
     ```

3. **Dashboard Configuration**
   - The dashboard JSON file defines the layout and visualizations for the Weather_ops application. Key panels include:
     - **Request Rate**: Displays the rate of HTTP requests per second.
     - **Response Time**: Shows the 95th and 50th percentile response times.
     - **Error Rate**: Monitors the percentage of 5xx errors.
     - **Model Predictions**: Tracks the total number of model predictions.
     - **Model Retraining Count**: Displays the number of times the model has been retrained.
     - **Data Upload Count**: Shows the total number of data uploads.

4. **Integration with Grafana**
   - The dashboard is integrated into Grafana using ConfigMaps and is automatically loaded into the Grafana instance.

#### Purpose of the Create Weather_ops Dashboard Stage

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Provides real-time insights into the performance and behavior of the Weather_ops application.

2. **Proactive Issue Detection**
   - Enables early detection of performance bottlenecks and errors through visualizations and alerts.

3. **Enhanced Observability**
   - Offers a centralized view of key metrics, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot the application.

---

#### Observations

1. **Comprehensive Metrics**
   - The dashboard includes a wide range of metrics, covering application performance, model behavior, and system health.

2. **Automated Setup**
   - The use of ConfigMaps and Kubernetes manifests automates the creation and deployment of the dashboard.

3. **Potential for Improvement**
   - The stage could include additional validation steps to ensure that the dashboard is loaded correctly in Grafana.

---

#### Recommendations

1. **Validate Dashboard Deployment**
   - Add steps to validate the dashboard deployment by checking the status of the Grafana pod and verifying the presence of the dashboard.
     ```bash
     kubectl get pods -n weather-ops
     kubectl logs deployment/grafana -n weather-ops
     ```

2. **Enhance Logging**
   - Add detailed logging to provide better insights into the dashboard creation process.

3. **Configure Alerts**
   - Set up alerts in Grafana for critical metrics, such as high error rates or slow response times.

4. **Test Dashboard Functionality**
   - Verify that all panels in the dashboard are displaying data correctly and that the metrics are up-to-date.

#### Benefits of the Create Weather_ops Dashboard Stage

1. **Improved Observability**
   - Provides a centralized view of application performance and resource usage.

2. **Proactive Monitoring**
   - Enables early detection of issues, reducing downtime and improving reliability.

3. **Streamlined Troubleshooting**
   - Simplifies the process of identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks and errors.
